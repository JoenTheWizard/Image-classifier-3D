# Todo
- Make the object classification (rendered to the OpenGL scene)
- Add a header in the weights file to check if the amount of neurons is corresponding to the loaded neural network
- Pass in arguments in CLI
- Extra error checking in the `ImageClassifier` class
- ~~Make base class for `Pyramid` and `Cube` (optional)~~
- Set some getters and setters in `ImageClassifier` class
- Set uniform buffer objects for the object shaders (optional)
